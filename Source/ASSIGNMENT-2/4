The k-NN is a non-parametric method used for classification. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor
As the value of k increases the the model will fit better into our training data by including all the possible regions,
On way to estimate the best value for k is to start with k=1 and the increment it gradually to fit the data set (70% approx.) so that we can include major part of the data set as it covers most of the samples
As k=1 it may not include all the samples form the data set and when k=50 it may cover most of the samples form the data set, there by calculating the results more accurately.
